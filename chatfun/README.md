# Chatfun.py

I created this plugin to create a little bit of fun on the server that doesn't ahve to do with playing.

The server will respond to things said in the server in chat and with some !commands.

Use <b>!fun</b> to see what commands will get a repsonse.

Command(s) available with chatfun.py listed with the set permission level.

<b>â€¢	Permission level 4</b>

<b>!chatfun</b>

Turns the automatic response to certain words said in normal chat on or off.
This will override the setting in the config until the server is restarted.

Usage: !chatfun on|off

CVARs to be set.
